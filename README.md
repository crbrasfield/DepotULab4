The objective of this project was to have a button load at the top of the page on document.ready.
Clicking the button will generate a box with an .id that is equal to the number of boxes currently on the page.
Hovering your more over the box will display the .id of that specific box.
Clicking a box will change the background color to a randomly generated color.
Double clicking a box with an even .id number will delete the box to the left.
Double clicking a box with an odd .id number will delete the box to the right.
Trying to delete a box without a box to the appropriate side will result in an alert message.
